### Application.properties

This has been intentionally left out as it contains sensitive information such as credentials to the database. In order to run this application, please create the file **application.properties** in the folder **src/main/resources**

Provide the following properties:

```
server.port=<the running port you want (optional)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<hostname of database:port>/<schema name>
spring.datasource.username=<database username>
spring.datasource.password=<database user password>
